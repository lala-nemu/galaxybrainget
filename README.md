# galaxybrainget
A place to help users win their Galaxy Brain badge.

## How does it work?
1. Open a new discussion in this repository. It's on the navigation bar, right next to the Pull request section.
2. Wait for another user to reply, and *remember to mark their answer as the answer to your thread*. This will get *them* a point.
3. Now, comment twice in *two separate discussions which were not started by you* and wait for people to mark your answer too.
    Skip discussions which are already marked as Answered.
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with another user. You cannot mark your own replies as an answer.
5. ???
6. BADGE GET!!

## Etiquette?
* Please, remember to help other users too. Maybe mark your discussions as thread 1 and thread 2? Update discussions with a big, bold **ALREADY ANSWERED**.
* Don't be greedy, let others have their marked answers too.
* Of course, this badge is for bragging rights, remember to actually contribute to cool stuff ;)
* Have a nice day. Stretch out, drink some water, go for a walk. Healthy body, healthy mind, happier coding for everyone!
